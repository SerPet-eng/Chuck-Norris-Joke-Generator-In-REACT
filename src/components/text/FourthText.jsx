        Chuck Norris facts first surfaced on the Internet in early 2005, when
        YouTube and Facebook were just getting started, as they are now.
        Originally distributed in the Something Awful forums as the Chuck Norris
        Fact, the &quot;facts&quot; centered on Vin Diesel in response to his
        film The Pacifier. After a few months, forum members chose Chuck Norris
        to be the new subject

        Conan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Chuck Norris jokes on Late Night with Conan
        O&apos;Brien &#40;which mostly revolve around Walker, Texas Ranger&#41;
        have been cited as inspiration for the craze. The exaggerated tone of
        these statements is reminiscent of a Saturday Night Live spoof called
        &quot;Bill Brasky.&quot; Because of the phenomenon&apos;s success,
        similar jokes have been devised for a variety of other celebrities as
        well as fictional characters, and the rest is history.
